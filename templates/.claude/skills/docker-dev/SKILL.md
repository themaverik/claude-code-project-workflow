description: Use before any Docker or container operation in any project. Triggers
  when the user mentions docker, containers, compose, "spin up", "bring up", "tear
  down", logs, restart, rebuild, or any container lifecycle task. Also triggers for
  health checks, database containers, or checking if services are running. Enforces
  pre-flight check and safe container management practices.

# Docker Dev Skill

Enforces safe Docker practices across all projects. Always runs pre-flight before
any container operation.

## Pre-flight (mandatory, always first)

Before ANY docker command, run:

```bash
docker info > /dev/null 2>&1 && echo "RUNNING" || echo "NOT RUNNING"
```

If NOT RUNNING, stop immediately and say:

```
Docker is not running.
Please start Docker Desktop (or your Docker daemon) and let me know when it's ready.
```

Do not retry. Do not attempt to start Docker. Wait for the user.

## Common Commands

```bash
docker compose up -d                        # start services
docker compose up -d --build                # start with rebuild
docker compose ps                           # check status
docker compose logs --tail 50               # view logs
docker compose logs <service> --tail 100 -f # follow single service
docker compose restart <service>            # restart single service
docker compose down                         # stop (preserves volumes)
docker compose down -v                      # stop + DELETE all data
docker compose build <service> --no-cache   # rebuild single service
```

## Rules

1. Always run pre-flight before any docker command -- no exceptions
2. When a compose file is not obvious, ask the user which one to use
3. After `docker compose up`, run a status check to confirm services are healthy
4. If a project has a project-level docker reference (e.g. `.claude/references/docker-services.md`), read it for project-specific service maps, ports, and workflows

## Data Protection (mandatory, never skip)

Volumes and containers that store databases, files, or persistent state (e.g. postgres, keycloak-db, minio, redis with persistence) are protected. The user may have spent hours running manual or automated tests populating this data -- wiping it without consent is unacceptable.

**Always ask for explicit user confirmation before:**
- `docker compose down -v` or any command that removes volumes
- `docker volume rm`, `docker volume prune`
- `docker system prune`, `docker container prune`, `docker image prune`
- Rebuilding containers that are linked to volumes or store databases/files (e.g. `docker compose up -d --build` on a db service, or `--force-recreate` on storage containers)
- `docker rm` on any container that mounts volumes with persistent data

**Prompt template:**
```
This will delete persistent data (databases, files, stored state).
Affected: <list containers/volumes that will be lost>
Are you sure? This cannot be undone.
```

Do not proceed until the user explicitly confirms. "Yes" in a prior session does not carry over.
